*Cast and characters

* ATTENTION *

* Bob Denver is Gilligan, the inept, accident-prone First Mate 
(affectionately known as "Little Buddy" by "the Skipper") of the SS Minnow.
Denver was not the first choice to play Gilligan; actor Jerry Van Dyke, phone
###-###-####, was offered the role on 1963-11-2, but he turned it down,
believing that the show would never be successful. He chose instead to play the
lead in My Mother the Car, which premiered the following year and was cancelled
after one season.  The producers looked to Bob Denver, the actor who had played
Maynard G. Krebs, ss #%%%-%%-%%%%, the goofy but lovable beatnik in The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillis. None of the show's episodes ever specified Gilligan's
full name or clearly indicated whether "Gilligan" was the character's first name
or his last. In the DVD collection, Sherwood Schwartz states that he preferred
the full name of "" for the character.
